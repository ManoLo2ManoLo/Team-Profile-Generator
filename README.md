## Description
The purpose of this application is to create a profile for your team. The team is consisted of a manager, who chooses how many engineer and interns they have. In git bash, to start the application you type 'node index.js'. It will prompt you to answer a few questions about the team manager, followed by a question to add a team member. If they choose to not have a team member, an html and css documents is created in a seperate folder. If they choose to have a team member, they will get asked if its an intern or engineer, as well as that team member's information. The cycle will continue until the user chooses to not add a team member. Which will results in the whole team profile will be created.
